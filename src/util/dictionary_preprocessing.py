'''
File used for preprocessing the greek word dictionary. It includes over 
1 million words - most of which are not actually used often - so we
create a new dictionary that includes every row of the original one
that has a frequency greater than 1.

Original disctionary layout:
    â‡’ {word} {frequency}
    
Original dictionary: 1047200

Processed dictionary: 580641

Removed rows: 466559
